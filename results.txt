['When I flip coins they land on heads half the time.Let\'s think step by step, I tossed a coin and it landed on heads, so I got 1 head. Now, I toss a coin. What is the probability it will land on heads?\n\n[Answer 1]\n\nThis is known as a "geometric distribution",\n\nand if you flip the coin $n', "When I flip coins they land on heads half the time.Let's think step by step, I tossed a coin and it landed on tails.
